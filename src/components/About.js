					Physical challenges have always excited me - I cycled{' '}
					<nobr>a distance</nobr> of 240 km (149 mi) in a single day, ran a <nobr>
						half
						marathon (1 h 44 min)
					</nobr> and can do some weird yoga asanas. But it turned
					out that solving logical, programmatic problems can be as addictive as
					post-heavy-workout high.
					<br />
					<br />
					So I embarked on an exciting journey and decided to become a software
					developer.
					<br />
					<br />
					Let's look at some recent facts:
					<br />
					<ul>
						<li>
							In my last job I was promoted twice, up to project coordinator.
						</li>
						<li>
							I finished the intermediate JS path from The Odin Project Course.
						</li>
						<li>Improved my English from shaky B2 to usable C1.</li>
						<li>Learned touch typing.</li>
						<li>Practice playing guitar five days a week.</li>
					</ul>
					All of these things require effort, good organization and consistent
					execution <nobr>- thatâ€™s what you can expect of me.</nobr>
