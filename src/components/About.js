				Challenges have always excited me - I cycled <nobr>a distance</nobr>{' '}
				of 240 km (149 mi) in a single day, ran a half marathon{' '}
				<nobr>(1 h 44 min)</nobr> and can do some weird yoga asanas. To my amusement it
				turned out that solving logical, programmatic problems can be as
				addictive as post workout endorphins rush.
				<br />
				<br />
				So I embarked on an exciting journey and decided to become a software
				developer.
				<br />
				<br />
				Let's look at some things I've been doing recently:
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li>Started learning Backend Development</li>
					<li>Completed Frontend part of The Odin Project Course</li>
					<li>Completed Harvard CS50 Course</li>
					<li>Improved my English from B2 to C1</li>
					<li>Learned touch typing</li>
				</ul>
				Each of the above points require effort, good organization and consistent
				execution <nobr>- thatâ€™s what you can expect of me.</nobr>
