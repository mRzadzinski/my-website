						Challenges have always excited me - I cycled <nobr>a distance</nobr>{' '}
						of 240 km (149 mi) in a single day, ran a half marathon{' '}
						<nobr>(1 h 44 min)</nobr> and can do some weird yoga asanas. But it
						turned out that solving logical, programmatic problems can be as
						addictive as post workout endorphins rush.
						<br />
						<br />
						So I embarked on an exciting journey and decided to become a software
						developer.
						<br />
						<br />
						Let's look at some things I've been doing recently:
						<br />
						<ul>
							<li>Completed Harvard CS50 Course</li>
							<li>Completed Frontend JS Path from The Odin Project Course</li>
							<li>Improved my English from B2 to C1</li>
							<li>Learned touch typing</li>
							<li>Learn to play guitar</li>
						</ul>
						All of these things require effort, good organization and consistent
						execution <nobr>- thatâ€™s what you can expect of me.</nobr>
