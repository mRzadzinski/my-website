				What melts my heart are thick, slightly overdriven, electric blues solos
				from the 60s. That’s why the choice of what to offer in my mockup online
				store was easy.
				<br />
				<br />
				Thought process:
				<br />
				How to render a particular component on the url change? Oh, it's called
				React Router... No problem.
				<br />
				React Testing Library? I haven’t used it yet, but give me a moment…

				For this project I had to face a major challenge - namely, pick 30 of my
				favorite music albums. And it was a fun way to practice React functional
				components with hooks.

				<br />
				Yes, I do use Spotify, how did you know that?

				It’s such a well-worn project idea that I needed some twist to make it
				geek friendly (for myself of course).
				<br />
				My first exposure to React and concepts like: JSX, props, state, hooks
				and above all - components.
